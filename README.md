# VIX-replication
The replication is focused on SP500 options for 1Q2016 because of the limited amount of detailed data. The Implied Volatility has been interpolated by using Bakshi, Kapadia and Madan (2003) formula. 

In the first part, we estimated and interpolated the IV for a maturity of 30 days.
In the second part, we plotted the actual VIX and tested the correlation of our estimation with the real one.
